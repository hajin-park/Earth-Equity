                                How do Stocks relate to Earth Equity?

                                Stocks change with trends which can be either
                                upward or downward. Like the name states, when a
                                trend is upward, as time goes on, the value of
                                the stock increases. On the other hand, when a
                                stock has a downward trend, the value of stock
                                decreases as time goes on. This is something
                                that is analogous with Earth Equity. When
                                looking at datasets, as time changes, there are
                                changes to the values in the datasets; they
                                either increase or decrease. When choosing an
                                equity on Earth Equity, you will choose a
                                "stock" that will either have an upward or
                                downward trend. This is something that you must
                                determine when you select your time frames and
                                your amounts. Knowing whether your Equity will
                                have an upward or downward trend is essential to
                                "profitting" on Earth Equity.

                                The term stock market refers to several
                                exchanges in which shares of publicly held
                                companies are bought and sold. Such financial
                                activities are conducted through formal
                                exchanges and via over-the-counter (OTC)
                                marketplaces that operate under a defined set of
                                regulations. Both “stock market” and “stock
                                exchange” are often used interchangeably.
                                Traders in the stock market buy or sell shares
                                on one or more of the stock exchanges that are
                                part of the overall stock market. The leading
                                U.S. stock exchanges include the New York Stock
                                Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq.
